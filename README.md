# Transportation Problem Solver

This repository contains a Python implementation for solving the transportation problem using:

1. **PuLP Solver**
2. **Revised Simplex Method**

You can see the solution set and compare the efficiency of the PuLP solver and the Revised Simplex Method by creating random problems via the `generate_problem` method.
